#Discord bot

A work in progress, that I visit on and off. Originally wanted to design a MUD (Multi User Dungeon)
but that proved sort of difficult, so my main goal now is to make a discord bot that functions as the
server for an adventure RPG.

Presently, most of the development is going into making the map tool, which can be used to make a
map and NPCs. I intend, afterwards, to make a "quest" tool, with which you will be able to easily
make quests and dialogue trees, so that anyone can make their own adventure on this bot. 


For running this bot-
run "node index.js"


For running the map tool-
in the utilities folder, run "python map.py" or "python3 map.py" depending on your system's configuration

If you intend to run this bot yourself, there is a secret key you'll have to generate and then store on
your system. More info can be found at https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/#using-config-json
