This is the tool for generating the map

TODO:
generate json
support for NPCs

need to add a checkbox for NESW that determines
what directions you can move from each box
 - CHECK BOX, not the list that's set up now
 - won't randomly delete


future improvements - 
 - wrap the gui in a class that holds the info rather
then locking myself into globals
 - make each button a frame containing a button, rather
 than a raw button so I can add things like frames on the
 sides to indicate whether an area can be passed through
 - Thinking about adding NPCs to this tool, as well as
 the ability to write quests into the tool.
 - just add a new field onto each location for NPCs
 - or do NPCs as another pass- maybe in the menu add a 
 button for edit NPCs which gives a list of NPCs and then
 at the end of generation you just add to each location
 based on where the NPCs are
 - thinking about stardew valley style NPCs that work on
 a schedue of being in certain places at certain points
 in the day. e.g. at noon on weekdays, X character has lunch
 at Y location. Then they walk back to work at the market
