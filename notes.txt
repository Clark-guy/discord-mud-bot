MUD in discord

Accidentally uploaded token- then changed it. amazing how fast discord catches
	that sort of thing.

I'm going to need to think about how to direct bot to specific users - store game data for each character in a database,
then when bot receives a command check the user against the database. maybe have it whisper to each person?


How to store game data in database??
what exactly needs to be stored

player locations
player healths

quest statuses
