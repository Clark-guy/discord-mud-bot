MUD in discord

Accidentally uploaded token- then changed it. amazing how fast discord catches
	that sort of thing.

I'm going to need to think about how to direct bot to specific users - store game data for each character in a database,
then when bot receives a command check the user against the database. maybe have it whisper to each person?


How to store game data in database??
what exactly needs to be stored

player locations
player healths

quest statuses


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

how will turns work?

how will the database store info from multiple games???

Make the database store a single "game" object
make the game object only reachable by a certain party leader - that
person initiates game, and can load it back up


Creating characters - should be given the option to join or create a party.
when creating a party - make a new party schema, add discord user id

Where I'm at now - the bot can read and write to database
User is capable of creating a new party on the server, creating characters

TODO now...
 - make it so adding to the party works
 - make it so I can print the party status to the player
 - make it so removing from the party works

questions..
 - Should there be a "party level"? This might cause issue if I don't
 	lock in the party members early on. E.g. players in party level up to 10 or so,
	then they drop out 3 out of 4 members and replace with little babies.
	 - Maybe party level can be based on all party members' levels? so that
	 	game scales appropriately, can switch players in or out (This seems
		like a good idea to me)
 - Need a main questline to start working on
 - should add a perception check in any given area- say an area has 10 perception checks in it,
 	but player only succeeds at 1 or 2 at low level- incentivizes players to return to old
	locations. Maybe when returning to an area where player perception level has increased
	have bot say something like "You sense something has changed about this place... roll perception?"


##Architecture of a Map nodes

 - Map Nodes will indicate places like cities, paths, forests, etc. Some cities should maybe
	even be split into multiple map nodes - west ardoigneou, for example
 - Within a map node, there will be: Buildings, visible characters (e.g. people in a town square).
 	In each building there will be visible characters and invisible characters
