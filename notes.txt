MUD in discord

Accidentally uploaded token- then changed it. amazing how fast discord catches
	that sort of thing.

I'm going to need to think about how to direct bot to specific users - store game data for each character in a database,
then when bot receives a command check the user against the database. maybe have it whisper to each person?


How to store game data in database??
what exactly needs to be stored

player locations
player healths

quest statuses









how will turns work?

how will the database store info from multiple games???

Make the database store a single "game" object
make the game object only reachable by a certain party leader - that
person initiates game, and can load it back up


Creating characters - should be given the option to join or create a party.
when creating a party - make a new party schema, add discord user id
